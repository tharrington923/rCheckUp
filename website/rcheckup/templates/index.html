                     <!-- <h4> <b> Motivation </b> </h4> -->
                     User engagement is one of the most important metrics for determining
                     the overall health of a website. Online forums like Reddit.com are particularly
                     interesting because the content is generated entirely by its users. There are
                     multiple types of Reddit users; ranging from people who post/comment as frequently
                     as everyday to the users who lurk and never comment/post. In January 2013, 46% of
                     the posts and 25% of the comments were produced by engaged users.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     <b> Engaged users </b> are the users who either post or comment
                     on five or more days in a given month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The health of a subreddit (specific forum on Reddit) is dependent on the amount
                    of content being produced.
                    By predicting growth or decline before it happens, Reddit can intervene
                    and implement changes to alter the trajectory of a subreddit. Additionally,
                    subbreddits can be classified by predicted growth to investigate the characteristics
                    of each type of growth.
                  </p>
                   <p>
                     <h4> <b> Project </b> </h4>
                     The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to forecast how
                     the number of engaged users who are active in a specific
                     subreddit will change.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     <h4> <b> Motivating the Definition of Engaged Users </b> </h4>
                     The graph on the right shows the number of users
                     as a function of the minimum number of days that they either post or comment in January 2013.
                     For a given X, the number of users includes all users that produce content on X or more days.
                     This is represented in the plot by the shaded orange area under the curve.
                     The horizontal grey line represents 10% of the number of users who post or comment on one day.

                    The Reddit data consists of entries for every single comment
                    and post. Each post/comment contains a timestamp,
                    the title, body, author, subreddit, score, and many other fields.
                    The data is available on Google BigQuery from present back to 2006. However,
                    I focus on the 2013-2014 data in this project.

                    Using SQL and BigQuery, monthly time series were constructed for each subreddit for
                    the number of engaged users,
                    the total number of characters in comments/posts,
                    the total score (aggregate of up and down votes on comments/posts),

                One of the most common methods used to model times series models are autoregressive models.
                An autoregressive model is used when modeling the time series of a quantity
                that depends on values of the quantity at earlier times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving Average (MA) models are also commonly used in time series modeling.

                    Then, the standard deviation for the time series (2/2013-8/2014) was computed.
                    If the value of the predicted number of engaged users in November
                    fluctuated more than one standard deviation from the baseline,
                    the prediction was classified as growing or shrinking depending on the direction. If not,
                    then the subreddit was classified as not changing.

                    the hockey subreddit. The shaded blue region represents the
                    region being predicted. The ARMAX models performed significantly better than the
                    ARMA models. The ARMA models obtained around 40% prediction accuracy across the
                    161 subreddits investigated, while the ARMAX obtained over 60% accuracy.
                    Inclusion of more exogenous features is likely to yield even more accurate models,
                    but could not be explored due to the time constraints of this project.

                    performed in comparison to the true trend of the subreddits.
                    While many of the subreddits were classified as not changing,
                    it is important to minimize the number of subreddits incorrectly
                    predicted in the top right and bottom left. The large number captured as
                    not changing is the direct result of how growth was classified.
                    It would be bad for a subreddit to be predicted to grow and then shrink.
